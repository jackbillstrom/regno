# regno

`regno` is an application for looking up vehicle registration numbers and car information.

- ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª Supports Swedish Plates
- ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡ª Supports Irish Plates
- **Spanish, Finnish, and German plates coming soon!**

**Hint:** This project is still in development and was created as my learning experience for Rust. E.g it lacks moderate error-handling for now.

## Features

- `biluppgifter/types.rs`: Contains the types used for describing car information.
- `biluppgifter.rs`: Performs operations for fetching and processing Swedish car information. ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª
- `ncts.rs`: Performs operations for fetching and processing Irish car information. ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡ª
- `main.rs`: The main program where everything runs.
- `utils.rs`: Helper functions and utilities used throughout the project.
