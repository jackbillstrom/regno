**Hint:** This project is still in development and was created as my learning experience for Rust. E.g., it lacks moderate error-handling for now.

## Features

- `types.rs`: Contains the types used for describing car information.
- `biluppgifter.rs`: Performs operations for fetching and processing Swedish car information. ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª
- `ncts.rs`: Performs operations for fetching and processing Irish car information. ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡ª
- `main.rs`: The main program where everything runs.
- `utils.rs`: Helper functions and utilities used throughout the project.
